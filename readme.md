TheBay Open Competition Website
===============================

Built using nothing but static HTML, javascript and CSS.  No images. As well as being a functional site, this site performs a number of neat tricks:

*  Changing background based on search results from the Flickr API.
*  Embedded entry form using EventBrite.
*  Competition entries, displayed using a combination of the EventBrite API, Json2JsonP.com and Mustache templates.
*  CSS Transitions for menu animations.

Feel free to use parts or use it as a template for other projects.
